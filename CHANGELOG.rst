Version 1.0 - 2025-11-01
------------------------
**Initial Stable Release** of the Dynamic Field Translations module, featuring:

**Registry Patching** - Applies translation support automatically during install and on every server restart.  
**Safe Rollback** - Stores the original state of each field to revert cleanly when deactivated or uninstalled.  
**Field Type Guardrails** - Restricts usage to Char, Text, HTML, and Selection fields to avoid unsafe toggles.  
**Administrator Console** - Provides a dedicated menu with tree & form views for managing translation rules.  
**Inline Toggle Enablement** - Instantly exposes the EN / EL translation switch for configured fields.
